# AI-Safety-Research
Safety research is one of the most vital fields in emerging tech, but it receives insufficient attention and funding because everyone wants to launch new initiatives, but no one wants to maintain the existing ones.
I will include every research paper I read and review in this repository. I obviously do not own the rights to any of these research papers, and if people want me to remove their work, I shall.
I will focus on actual published articles rather than the glut of self-published or pay-to-publish articles that are becoming pervasive in AI research.
